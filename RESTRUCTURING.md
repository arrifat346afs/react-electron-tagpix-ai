# Codebase Restructuring

This document outlines the changes made to restructure the codebase according to modern React best practices.

## Completed Changes

1. **New Folder Structure**
   - Created a modern React folder structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Implemented a Next.js-inspired route grouping system
   - Organized components by feature and responsibility

2. **Component Improvements**
   - Updated components to use TypeScript properly
   - Implemented proper loading and error states
   - Added better type definitions
   - Improved component organization

3. **State Management**
   - Consolidated context providers
   - Improved state handling in components

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with new structure information
   - Added detailed comments to code

## Remaining Work

1. **Component Migration**
   - Move remaining components from `src/ui` to the new structure
   - Update imports in all files

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for key features

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Update Vite configuration to work with the new structure
   - Optimize build process

4. **Performance Improvements**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add lazy loading for routes
   - Optimize image processing

## Migration Guide

To continue the migration process:

1. Move components from `src/ui/components` to `src/components`
2. Update imports in all files
3. Test each component after migration
4. Update the build configuration

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow the folder structure outlined in the README
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement proper error handling
- Use loading states for async operations
- Write tests for all new components
